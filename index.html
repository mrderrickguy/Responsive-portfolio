		<p> 
		My name is Derrick, and I'm in the process of re-eventing myself. And the way I'm going about it will be very challenging and yet be strengthening.Not only am I doing this for myself, but I'm also doing this for my family as well, and hopefully I will inspire others to take a chance to dream big and follow there hearts and goals along the way. All my life I worked jobs that I felt where in my opinion "manly jobs." Like being a mover, machine operator, and construction worker. Even though I didn't mind doing these jobs, I felt like I'm getting nowhere fast.
		 </p> <br> <p> So on top of getting injured on my last job and having no experience doing anything other than a laboring job, I felt it's time for a serious career change. After entering a program so what like the one (boot camp style), I received my CompTIA A+ certificate and got my foot in the IT door as a computer repair technician. Still not happy with where I'm at I decided to apply for the coding boot-camp at the U of M. With that being said, here I am.</p>
